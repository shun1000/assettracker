- Switched external Scandit Engine library to allow memory growth in order to prevent random memory allocation failures.

## 1.4.0 (2018-01-08)

- Added new Scandit Parser Library support to parse data string into structured data. For details refer to the new `Parser` object and the [Scandit Parser Library's documentation](https://docs.scandit.com/parser/index.html).
- Added new `BarcodePicker.createParserForFormat` and `Scanner.createParserForFormat` functions to create and use `Parser` objects.
- Improved documentation.

## 1.3.2 (2017-12-21)

- Fixed external Scandit Engine library still already registering a device activation on initial configuration in some cases.

## 1.3.1 (2017-12-19)

- Fixed external Scandit Engine library registering a device activation on initial configuration: now a device registered only at the time the first frame is processed. This means that unused `Scanner` objects or `BarcodePicker` objects starting in a paused state or with no camera access will no longer trigger registrations.

## 1.3.0 (2017-12-15)

- Implemented functionality to delay camera access (and thus possible user permission requests) to after a `BarcodePicker` has been created, allowing for early external Scandit Engine library initialization.
- Added new `accessCamera` option to `BarcodePicker.create` to enable/disable camera access on picker creation.
- Added new `BarcodePicker.accessCamera` function to access the camera after picker creation (if disabled on creation).
- Updated *adapter* library to version 6.0.3.
- Updated *eventemitter3* library to version 3.0.0.
- Updated *tslib* library to version 1.8.1.

- Fixed possible problems during camera detection for some older browsers.
- Fixed camera initialization failing for some combinations of browsers/devices incorrectly reporting camera failures.
- Fixed camera initialization sometimes failing in *Safari* mobile on *iOS* 11.0 - 11.0.2.
- Fixed `BarcodePicker` element sometimes overflowing its given origin element by 1 pixel.

## 1.2.1 (2017-11-29)

- Fixed `BarcodePicker` not getting hidden when the relative option or function is provided/called.
- Fixed incorrect `BarcodePicker` visibility option and function only partially hiding the containing element.
- Fixed `BarcodePicker`'s `originElement` being left in an inconsistent state after being destroyed.
- Fixed incorrect camera front/back detection on some devices set to a system language different from english.

## 1.2.0 (2017-11-27)

- Deprecated `BarcodePicker.create`'s `uiStyle` option in favor of `guiStyle`.
- Deprecated `BarcodePicker.UIStyle.SCANLINE` in favor of `BarcodePicker.GuiStyle.LASER` to be consistent with other existing Scandit SDKs.
- Added new `BarcodePicker.setGuiStyle` function to set the GUI of the picker after creation.
- Correctly detect failed camera initialization in various situations due to unforeseen hardware issues and reject promises with a `NotReadableError` error plus close the video stream when it's the case.
- Fixed broken camera selection in `BarcodePicker` when one of the cameras cannot be accessed.
- Improved README documentation.
- Improved `BarcodePicker` documentation.

## 1.1.0 (2017-11-17)

- Implemented tap-to-focus camera functionality for devices supporting it (currently available only in *Chrome*).
- Implemented device torch/torchlight toggle functionality and relative button for devices supporting it (currently available only in *Chrome*).

- Improved README documentation.
- Improved CHANGELOG format.
- Improved documentation navigation.

## 1.0.8 (2017-11-15)

- Implemented automatic regularly triggered focus procedure for cameras not supporting continuous focus mode (but supporting at least manual focus); this greatly increases usability and scanning performance. Currently available only in *Chrome*.
- Fixed incorrect domain name detection and verification in *Edge*.
- Improved `BarcodePicker` documentation.

## 1.0.7 (2017-11-13)

- Fixed `ScanditSDK.configure` not rejecting in case of unsupported browsers when not performing any of the preloading functions, now the promise is correctly rejected.
- Fixed incorrect error thrown on `ScanditSDK.configure` calls in case of unsupported browsers, now the promise is correctly rejected with said error.
- Fixed incorrect error thrown on `ScanditSDK.loadEngineLibrary` calls in case of unsupported browsers, now the promise is correctly rejected with said error.
- Fixed incorrect error thrown when a code containing data in non-UTF-8 format is scanned, now the barcode result is correctly created with an empty parsed data string.

- Fixed incorrect camera initialization and metadata storage in *Firefox mobile*.

## 1.0.5 (2017-11-10)
